Hello Reader!
I am La Loba, a Computer Science Gradute Student.
I am a Web developer and ML/DS enthusiast.
I am a reader, coder and learner.
When I'm working i search, read, watch, code and make.
In my free time i search, read, watch, code and make.
I'm here to deploy my cool and uncool stuffs, some for you, some for me and some for the recruiters(they keep asking for it),
and i'm here to stock my favorite coders too.

P.S- Have a good day and at least open your VS Code once in a day.
